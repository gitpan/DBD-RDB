DBD::RDB - Oracle RDB driver for DBI (VMS only)

Copyright (c) 2000 Andreas Stiller, Germany.

See COPYRIGHT section in DBI.pm of the DBI-module for usage and 
distribution rights.

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    1) Install Oracle RDB with development option (SQLMOD is needed),
       since i don't know if it legally OK to distribute object modules.
    2) Install the DBI module (I tested with DBI 1.14)

BUILDING

    Unpack the DBD::RDB files and 
	    perl Makefile.PL
	    mmk                    (or mms)
	    mmk test
	    mmk install

End.
