Version 1.1
  
new:
	1) attribute {DateFormat} during connect taking lib$dt_xxx format
           which gives the input and output format for this connect
        2) statement attributes (hopefully) supported as described in
	   "Programming the perl DBI"
	
bugs fixed:
        1) hide "end of stream" error for a select in the "do" method
	2) a insert statement executed more than once stored NULL into a 
	   column everytime after the first NULL
        3) makefile.pl: reference to the DBI-source directory changed to 
           the DBI install directory
        4) $dbh->tables method fixed
	5) statement attribute "Hold" for select statements works now
           correctly. Such a cursor survives a commit.
	6) $dbh->do method use EXEC IMMEDIATE now only if no attr and 
	   no bind_values are present. Otherwise it prepares and executes.
