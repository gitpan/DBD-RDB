Version 1.16, (1.6.2002)

New Features:
        1) Named parameter markers
        2) bind_param_input
        => Stored procedures with IN,OUT and INOUT parameters are usable
        3) support for date INTERVALs
        4) more testing
        5) little bit more docu

Bugs fixed:
        1) makefile now use a $SET PROC/PARSE=TRAD
        2) memory leaks in fetch_attrib for sth and dbh

tested with:
        RDB 7.1, VMS 7.3
        DBI 1.23
        PERL 5.6.1 and 5.7.3 (DBI needed manual intervention to compile here)

Version 1.15, (6.8.2001)

Bugs fixed:
        1) 'Statement' attribute of statement handle is now handled by DBI
           and not from driver 
        2) Makefile defines LNK$LIBRARY to use SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USER.OLB

Version 1.14

Bugs fixed:
        1) a string sent from perl to RDB was cut at the first \000 eventually
	   taking not the full length. This disabled working with DBKEYs.


Version 1.13

Bugs fixed:
        1) install failed during "mms test" not finding rdb.pm,
           Fixed with the help of Peter Prymmer.
        2) integer datatypes having a precision like integer(2) had
           trailing whitespace if chopblanks option was off
        3) during the "destroy" of a statement handle, the corresponding
	   SQL statement is now released to RDB. The bug resulted in locking
           when trying to do metadata changes with a statement handle 
	   hanging around. The release happens when the statement handle
	   is undef'ed.

Known Problems:
        1) An open database handle seems to lock some operations with a
           "client xxx lock". E.g. a spawned RMU/LOAD starts working
           only after disconnecting.
	2) Build fails with MMS in an ODS-5 directory -> use MMK
        3) The build fails during SQLMOD when extended parse style is on -> 
	   disable extended parse style with $ set proc/parse=traditional
        4) The distribution is created with a "mms dist" now. This
	   results in all lowercase filenames, which should not
	   hurt at least for VMS

Version 1.12

Bugs fixed:
	1) The tarfile containes filenames without the correct cases, e.g.
           "makefile.pl" instead of "Makefile.PL"


Version 1.11

Bugs fixed:
	1) in version 1.1 i use two driver specific database handle 
	   attribute names: "DateFormat" and "Hold" which are not
	   compliant to the DBI standard. They are changed to:
	   "rdb_dateformat" and "rdb_hold"
	   

Version 1.1
  
new:
	1) attribute {DateFormat} during connect taking lib$dt_xxx format
           which gives the input and output format for this connect
        2) statement attributes (hopefully) supported as described in
	   "Programming the perl DBI"
	
bugs fixed:
        1) hide "end of stream" error for a "insert as select" in the "do" 
           method
	2) a insert statement executed more than once stored NULL into a 
	   column everytime after the first NULL
        3) makefile.pl: reference to the DBI-source directory changed to 
           the DBI install directory
        4) $dbh->tables method fixed
	5) statement attribute "Hold" for select statements works now
           correctly. Such a cursor survives a commit.
	6) $dbh->do method use EXEC IMMEDIATE now only if no attr and 
	   no bind_values are present. Otherwise it prepares and executes. 

Version 1.0, initial release
